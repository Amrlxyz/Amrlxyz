### Current Projects

[__Vehicle Control Unit (VCU)__](https://github.com/ManchesterStingerMotorsports/f446-vcu): The "brain" of our EV Formula Student car implemented with FreeRTOS, critical for managing core functionalities such as throttle control, telemetry and fault detection/handling.

[__Battery Management System (BMS)__](https://github.com/ManchesterStingerMotorsports/g474-bms): Microcontroller firmware that manages the safety of the car's 400V+ battery pack. It includes my own custom SPI-to-isoSPI hardware driver for communication with ADMBS ICs.

### Past Projects

[__Autonomous Line Following Buggy__](https://github.com/Amrlxyz/esp-lfr-buggy): Final Race Winner! Designed and built a custom autonomous buggy, programmed with Mbed in C++. Implemented cascaded PID control, state machine architecture, with multiple timer interrupts.


[__Brake System Plausibility Device PCB__](https://github.com/ManchesterStingerMotorsports/BSPD): A safety-critical component of the car that performs plausibility check between brake pressure and throttle position only using non-programmable logic.
